# Voron Trident

These parts will allow installation of WobbleX Isolators WS8 on Voron Trident.  

Notes:
* 1 - The maximum Z travel distance will be reduced by 17mm with this mod.
* 2 - I do not own a Voron Trident, these parts have not been physically validate.  See the [Feedback](/Voron/Trident/README.md) section.
